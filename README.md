This contains all the code and libraries
Please download all the files in this repository 
so you can use the library and headers


/n Spencer If you use these for matlab you dont the the controlSystem.ino file
make your own main file.



rotary encoders use pull up resistors.
pinA = left and pinB = right it doesnt really matter just use the constructor

relays are low to turn on


connect stepper motor negative pins to ground.
